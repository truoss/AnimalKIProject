# Node_Editor
Node Editor framework for Unity3D

This project aims to create an easy-to-use framework for creating graph-based displays in the Unity Editor.

The project was started as a part of the ["Simple Node Editor"](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/simple-node-editor.189230/) thread on the Unity forums, started by user [unimechanic](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/unimechanic.177360/).
The inital code was provided by the user [Seneral](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/seneral.638015/) (thanks!), and the repository was set up by [Baste Nesse Buanes](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/baste.185905/)

Additional credits go to [vexe](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/vexe.280515/) for his Fast.Reflection utility that supports heavy reflection usage in Node Editor enabling revolutionary editor hacks like scaling to run smoothly.
